# Getting started with Python in VS Code
This workshop is intended to get people started with Python development using VS Code, a lightweight extensible integrated development environment (IDE).
It is not really intended to teach you Python - Python code will be used for demonstrations, as well as Jupyter notebooks, but the aim is to get you to the point where you can either follow Python tutorials easily, inspect and modify other people's Python code, or even start your own project!
To this end, we will cover some useful aspects of VS Code such as integration with git, conda environments, and remote development.

Ladislav Hovan

## Live troubleshooting session
No live troubleshooting session is planned, but feel free to send me an email at ladislav.hovan@ncmbm.uio.no if you have any questions prior to the workshop!

## Software requirements
It would be great if you could have VS Code already installed.
If you try and fail, don't worry, we will make sure that everyone has a working version in the beginning of the workshop!
You can download it from their [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but it is also available as an app in Microsoft Store (possibly elsewhere too - I'm not very familiar with Macs :smile:).

Apart from VS Code itself, in order to demonstrate conda environments, it would be nice to have a version of conda already installed as well.
In case you don't already have one, I would recommend miniconda, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success).
Of course, you can download Anaconda if you believe it will be useful for you later!

## Remote development
Maybe not all of you are interested in remote development (i.e. coding on a server), but it can be very useful if you would be executing your code on a remote machine anyway.
I will show how to do this in theory, but if you already have access to a server you can try it out during the session!
In case you are not already using a server, all UiO members have access to the UiO login nodes (a bad idea to run things there in general, but for a demonstration it will suffice).
Alternatively, you can apply for access to [Fox](https://www.uio.no/english/services/it/research/hpc/fox/).
I will try to come up with an alternative so that people without access to a server will also be able to try it out.
